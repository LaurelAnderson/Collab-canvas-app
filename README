Drawing app where multiple clients can connect to a server
and draw together and see everyone else's drawing in real-time.

Software requirements:
Clients will need to run the app in Android Studio
Server.java will need to run in separate IDE (recommend using IntelliJ)
Both will need dependencies setup to reference the Packet class
Install requirements:
	SDK packages
	2 x Pixel 2 API 32

How to run the project:
After downloading repo, Android Studio may change the SDK file location.
To check manually, go to File > Project Structure > SDK Location and then
make sure that the path is where the SDK file is located.

Next, open IntelliJ then File > New > Project from Existing Source...
and locate the server file: C:.\Desktop\Collab-canvas-app\app\server
To link the networking dependency, go File > Project Structure > Modules
then click the "+" then "Import Module" then locate the networking folder:
C:.\Desktop\Collab-canvas-app\app\networking
To link it, click on the "Dependencies" tab then "+" then select the networking
folder and click "OK". Once it populates, make sure the box next to it is checked.

Now build and run the Server.
Then start two instances of the app on two separate emulators from Android Studio.
