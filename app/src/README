Collaborative Drawing App 
We are making a collaborative drawing app. One person will start/host the app on their device.
Multiple people will be able to join or leave the session if it is getting hosted. There will 
be different colors people can use. We are planning to use Java socket programing to have a 
single server to many clients. A stretch goal is to have each person who joins the session
have an identifiable username that the host can keep track of. We also want the username for 
each participant show up when they are drawing.
